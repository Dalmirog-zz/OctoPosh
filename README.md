Octopus Deploy is a friendly deployment automation system for .NET developers. [Its architecture is built API-First](http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Octopus+REST+API), meaning 99% of what you can do from the Octopus UI can also be performed using the REST API.

This Powershell Module contains a set of CMDLets that use the Octopus REST API to perform common administrative tasks.
